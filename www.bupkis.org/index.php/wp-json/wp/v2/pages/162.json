Use everything except the thick, woody stems.<\/li>\n<li>Store the extra pesto in the refrigerator in a glass jar with a lid. Before refrigerating, smooth out the surface and gently float a thin layer of olive oil on top. The oil will keep air away from the pesto and will prevent it from discoloring.<\/li>\n<li>Basil Pesto was traditionally made with pine nuts, however I switched to dry-roasted, lightly-salted cashews because:\n<ul>\n<li>Cashews are about $6\/pound.
