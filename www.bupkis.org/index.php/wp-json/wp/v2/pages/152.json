You can also use one stone and bake one loaf while other loaf rises a little more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Directions:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Place the water in a medium bowl and warm to 80\u00b0F add 1 teaspoon of the sugar and whisk it. While still whisking, add the yeast.<\/li>\n<li>Let sit for 10 minutes. It should be foamy. If not, the yeast was old or dead, or the water was too hot. In either case, you&#8217;ll need to start over with fresh water, sugar and yeast.<\/li>\n<li>Place butter in a large glass bowl and microwave until just melted (not hot).<\/li>\n<li>Add milk, sugar, salt and honey. Whisk until dissolved. Warm in microwave for a few seconds if necessary to keep mixture warm enough so butter stays liquid.<\/li>\n<li>Whisk in the yeast\/water mixture and the eggs.<\/li>\n<li>Pour into the dough mixer and set on low and add the flour.<\/li>\n<li>Once it combines increase speed to medium and continue kneading until the dough can be <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thekitchn.com\/bakers-techniques-how-to-do-th-70784\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">windowpaned<\/a> (usually about 10 minutes)<\/li>\n<li>Dump the dough into a 6+ quart plastic tub with a lid and leave it at room temperature ovenight.<\/li>\n<li>Stretch dough out into an elongated blob and fold in half. Rotate 90\u00b0 and repeat until you have done this 4 times.<\/li>\n<li>Let it rise until dough has doubled again and repeat the above step<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Two hours before baking:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Put the pizza stone(s) in the oven(s) and preheat to 350\u00b0F (325\u00b0F in a convection oven)<\/li>\n<li>Dump dough out on to a lightly floured surface stretching into an elongated shape.<\/li>\n<li>Cut in half length-wise. Cut each half in thirds length-wise<\/li>\n<li>Stretch each piece into a rope about 16 inches long; it should be a little thicker in the center and tapered at the ends.<\/li>\n<li>Align the ropes vertically, side by side, and start braiding, twisting the left and middle, then the right and middle. Repeat until you reach the other end.<\/li>\n<li>Pinch the three strands on then end together to seal the end and tuck under the loaf. Do the same thing on the other end of the loaf.<\/li>\n<li>Liberally sprinkle cornmeal on a Pizza Peel (paddle) and place the braided dough on it.<\/li>\n<li>Do the same with the other three pieces of dough.<\/li>\n<li>Cover with a warm, damp towel and let rise at room temperature for about two hours, or until soft, puffy, and almost doubled.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>The Glaze &amp; Topping<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Whisk these together in a small bowl :<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 large egg<\/li>\n<li>1 large egg yolk<\/li>\n<li>1 tablespoon cold water<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Baking :<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Glaze the dough with the beaten egg mixture, then sprinkle with kosher salt, and the sesame or poppy seeds if you&#8217;re using them.<\/li>\n<li>Slide the dough from the peel onto the preheated baking stone(s) in the oven.<\/li>\n<li>Bake for 20 minutes. The loaves will expand and expose some of the inner, uncooked, unglazed dough.<\/li>\n<li>Brush the newly exposed dough with the reserved glaze<\/li>\n<li>Sprinkle with new area with seeds if you&#8217;re using them.<\/li>\n<li>Bake 15 to 20 minutes longer, or until the loaves are golden brown and sound hollow when thumped on the bottom, with an internal temperature of 195\u00b0F-200\u00b0F<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This is one of the most beautiful and tasty things to come out of my oven recently.
