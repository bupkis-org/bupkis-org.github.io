Not canned beef broth with some onions, soggy bread and cheap cheese. This recipe extracts nearly every possible flavor variation from the onions, via multiple deglazings and several different levels of cooking.<\/p>\n<p>The first batch of onion gets caramelized until there&#8217;s almost nothing left but wonderful fond. The second batch of onions gets cooked until mostly caramelized and very soft, the third even less and the fourth is left with a distinct &#8220;onion&#8221; flavor.<\/p>\n<p>It has a beautifully deep, rich flavor with layers of onion taste profiles ranging from deep, dark and sweet, to bright and slightly sharp with a little bite. The sherry provides a touch of brightness and the thyme and bay leaf provide a nice &#8220;green&#8221; note.<\/p>\n<p>The soup&#8217;s deep, rich flavor comes from <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Caramelization\">caramelization<\/a> of the onions. Traditionally, this is done just once when saut\u00e9ing the onions, however there&#8217;s no reason to stop there. The onions are still packed with potential flavor, and we&#8217;re going to get all of it!<\/p>\n<p>This recipe calls for sauteing a batch of onions until they&#8217;re nearly gone, then deglazing the pan with a little water. Then we do it again. And again, creating a deep, rich onion broth with huge flavor. The last batch of onions doesn&#8217;t get cooked quite as much, which creates an additional layer of flavor (a little sharp with a distinct onion flavor), which contrasts nicely with the rich, slightly sweet flavor in the broth.<\/p>\n<p>The garlic toast adds a nice garlicky bite, the aroma of the olive oil and a wonderful crunchy texture, the herbs and sherry brighten it up, and selecting the right cheese makes everything just about perfect.<\/p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Ingredients<\/strong>:<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"right\">5<\/td>\n<td>Lbs<\/td>\n<td>Yellow Onions, peeled, cut pole-to-pole, then 1\/4 inch thick<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"right\">4<\/td>\n<td>Tablespoons<\/td>\n<td>Unsalted Butter, cut into chunks<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"right\"><\/td>\n<td><\/td>\n<td>Water<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"right\">4<\/td>\n<td>Cups<\/td>\n<td>Low Sodium Chicken Broth<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"right\">2<\/td>\n<td>Cups<\/td>\n<td>Beef Broth<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"right\">1\/2<\/td>\n<td>C<\/td>\n<td><em>Dry<\/em> Sherry.

Sprinkle on a pinch salt and saute until completely caramelized and very dark brown. When the bottom of the pot is covered with fond, deglaze with a little water.\u00a0 Repeat until the onions are almost gone and there is a ton of rich, dark, brown fond in the bottom of the pot.

On the last batch, cook until the onions are softened, but not completely wilted, and deglaze with sherry.<\/li>\n<li>Add all the other ingredients except the salt and pepper and simmer for 30 minutes.<\/li>\n<li>Remove the bay leaf and the thyme.
