I looked for it for literally decades and am happy to thank Mike Caruso for sharing!<\/p>\n<p>The recipe calls for 1 pound of Cavatelli, cooked. I&#8217;m not really sure what this means. It could have been 1 pound of fresh pasta since some of their pasta was home made, or it could have been 1 pound dry, then cooked, or it could have been 1 pound of cooked pasta. I&#8217;m not really sure.<\/p>\n<p>Based on my admittedly foggy memory of the 1980&#8217;s I think it was a pound of fresh pasta, cooked. An entire 1 pound box of dry seems like too much and 1 pound cooked seems like too little.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mangia!<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cavatelli with Broccoli and Mushrooms and Garlic-Butter Sauce Aunt Josie&#8217;s is closed but the happy memories live on!
