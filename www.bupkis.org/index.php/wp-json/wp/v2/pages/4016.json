I don&#8217;t have that much patience. So I kept on looking.<\/p>\n<p>It turns out that a spice grinder (re-purposed coffee grinder) will nicely substitute for soaking.<\/p>\n<p>Now, on to the recipe!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Guinness, Horseradish and Sriracha Mustard <\/strong><\/p>\n<table class=\"ingredients\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Ingredients:<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2\/3<\/td>\n<td>C<\/td>\n<td>Black or brown mustard seeds (black is spicier).<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2\/3<\/td>\n<td>C<\/td>\n<td>Guinness Stout at room temperature<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2\/3<\/td>\n<td>C<\/td>\n<td>Freshly made <a title=\"Fresh Ground Horseradish\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bupkis.org\/index.php\/recipes-2\/sauces\/fresh-ground-horseradish\">horseradish<\/a><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6<\/td>\n<td><\/td>\n<td>Allspice berries<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1\/2<\/td>\n<td>teaspoon (or until the color looks right)<\/td>\n<td>Ground Turmeric<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0To Taste<\/td>\n<td><\/td>\n<td>Sriracha Garlic-Chili Sauce<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 (approx)<\/td>\n<td>T<\/td>\n<td>Sugar<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p><strong>Where to buy the ingredients:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Spices can be insanely expensive if you buy them in the wrong place.<\/p>\n<p>This recipe, for example, requires dried allspice berries. They&#8217;re almost impossible to find in any of the major grocery stores near me, and were extremely expensive in the places that did carry them. However just by chance, I tried Price-Rite and they had a half ounce package for less than $2, which is enough to keep me in mustard for at least a year. They seem to be less expensive and easier to find in grocery stores with a lot of Caribbean customers.<\/p>\n<p>Mustard seeds are another one. They&#8217;re $8 for a little jar in Price Chopper, but $2 for 14 ounces in the Asian and India markets.<\/p>\n<p>I was unable to find similar savings on the Guinness, however. \ud83d\ude0e<\/p>\n<p><strong>Directions:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Place the mustard seeds and allspice berries into the spice (coffee) grinder and grind until powdered and no visible chunks are flying around.<\/p>\n<p>Put the spice mixture (above) into a blender. Add Guinness as necessary to keep the mixture smoothly flowing in the blender. Stop and check the consistency. It should be about the same thickness as store-bought brown mustard. Add more Guinness if too thick. Turn off the blender.<\/p>\n<p>Let sit, and check the heat level every few minutes, for up to 15 minutes. It will increase over time. When it&#8217;s hot enough, restart the blender and add the horseradish. The vinegar in the horseradish will stabilize the heat level.<\/p>\n<p>Squeeze in Sriracha to taste. I used a couple of tablespoons, but it depends entirely on your taste preference. Stop and taste, adding more if you like it spicier.<\/p>\n<p>Add the turmeric, if desired. This helps with the traditional &#8220;mustard&#8221; color and a little bit of the flavor, but isn&#8217;t really necessary.<\/p>\n<p>(optional) add sugar to taste. This shouldn&#8217;t be sweet, but a touch of sugar gives it a more &#8220;round&#8221; multi-dimensional flavor.<\/p>\n<p>Transfer to a clean glass jar (I usually use a clean peanut butter jar) and refrigerate.<\/p>\n<p>Makes about 18 ounces of mustard.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Don&#8217;t Panic!
