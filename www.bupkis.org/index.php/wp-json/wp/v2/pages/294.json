She loved all the neighbors and kids, and when we had parties, would spend her time walking from guest to guest seeing if she could get a pat on the head or a treat.<\/p>\n<p>As she grew older, she developed arthritis in her spine, and by the time she was fourteen, could no longer get up off the floor. I couldn&#8217;t leave my friend like that, and decided to put her to sleep. It was the most difficult thing I have ever done, but I&#8217;ve never, even for a second, regretted adopting her and giving her seven happy years.<\/p>\n<p>If you have room in your life for unconditional love and want to make a real difference, consider <a href=\"http:\/\/www.grrowls.org\/Forms\/special_needs\/special.htm\" target=\"new\">adopting an older Golden Retriever<\/a>.
