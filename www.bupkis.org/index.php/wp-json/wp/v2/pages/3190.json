Any non-frozen shrimp you see in the store are just frozen shrimp that the store thawed.<\/p>\n<p>Since &#8220;spoilage clock&#8221; start ticking as soon as they get much above 0\u00b0F, always buy Individually Quick Frozen shrimp that are <em>still frozen<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Never buy pre-cooked shrimp, since you&#8217;re going to cook it. Twice-cooked shrimp are terrible.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Shopping Tip #2:<\/strong><br \/>\nIf the bag says &#8220;Individually Quick Frozen&#8221; but the shrimp are stuck together in a clump, don&#8217;t buy it! This means that the bag has been left sitting out somewhere (maybe the Laundry Detergent aisle), then tossed back in the freezer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The night before, if frozen:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Snip the corner off the bag and place the bag in a bowl, cut corner facing down to allow draining. Place in the refrigerator.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Cooking:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clean grill and set on high. Close lid.<\/li>\n<li>If not pre-cleaned and peeled, clean the shrimp! Remove the legs and all of the shell except for the tail and. If the seafood processor hasn&#8217;t done this for you, remove the &#8220;vein.&#8221; (actually the digestive tract) You want to eat the shrimp, not what it ate.<\/li>\n<li>Add a couple of tablespoons of Olive Oil in a bowl and add the Old Bay if you want. Mix well. Add the shrimp and toss to coat.<\/li>\n<li>Quickly place all the shrimp on the grill and wait until the bottom turns orange with some nice seared places where it contacted the grill (about two minutes). Turn over and cook another minute or until evenly done on both sides.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Enjoy!<\/p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t get much easier than this!<\/p>\n<p>Serves 3, or two really hungry people with a few left-over.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>(barbie, not Barbie) Shrimp cooked over a little plastic doll on fire is terrible.
