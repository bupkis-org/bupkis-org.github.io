However the anchovies also contain inosinate, which boosts the effect of the glutamates, giving the dish a huge taste and incredible depth. Note that <em>nobody<\/em> will be able to tell that the dish contains pork or anchovies. They&#8217;re there for their flavor boosting effect, not their flavor, which is undetectable. The gelatin is used to slightly thicken the sauce giving it the same texture as the classical french version that take can days to create.<\/p>\n<p>Please leave a note here and let me know how it came out, and if you and your guests liked it.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Ingredients:<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"right\">2<\/td>\n<td>Cloves<\/td>\n<td>Garlic<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"right\">3<\/td>\n<td><\/td>\n<td>Anchovy Filets<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"right\">1<\/td>\n<td>Tbsp<\/td>\n<td>Tomato Paste<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"right\">4<\/td>\n<td>Lbs<\/td>\n<td>Boneless Chuck Eye Roast (ask your butcher)<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"right\">4<\/td>\n<td>Ounces<\/td>\n<td>Salt Pork<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"right\">2<\/td>\n<td>Tbsp<\/td>\n<td>Vegetable Oil<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"right\">1<\/td>\n<td>Large<\/td>\n<td>Yellow Onion cut in half pole-to-pole, then sliced into 1\/8&#8243; slices.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"right\">4<\/td>\n<td>Medium<\/td>\n<td>Carrots, peeled, cut into 1&#8243; chunks<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"right\">\u00bc<\/td>\n<td>Cup<\/td>\n<td>All-Purpose Flour<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"right\">2<\/td>\n<td>Cups<\/td>\n<td>Medium body red wine, like Pinot Noir.
