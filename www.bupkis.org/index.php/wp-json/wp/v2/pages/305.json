She loves to run and so we take her out to the woods several times a week.<\/p>\n<p>After about two years, she stopped chewing the furniture and is now a model dog citizen, spending most of her free time taking naps, play-fighting with our kitten and sniffing &#8220;special&#8221; places on our walks.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s nothing quite like having your best friend greet you at the door and run around and bring toys every time you come home from work.

They caring for dozens of labs and hounds and need food and clean bedding every day; many need medical attention. They are funded only by your donations, so please<a href=\"http:\/\/helpinghoundsdogrescue.org\/donate\/\"> send them something.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>In fact, send them a bunch of money. I guarantee it will be put to very good use.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you&#8217;re in an income bracket where if your car breaks you grumble, but don&#8217;t have to choose between driving and eating, then you can also afford to send them a hundred dollars. It will give you a happy feeling inside that you can&#8217;t get from anything else.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sammi recently passed away, at a little less than 14 years old.
