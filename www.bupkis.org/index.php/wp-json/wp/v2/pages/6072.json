Whisk slowly while the butter melts. Once it&#8217;s melted, continue whisking slowly as it bubbles and foams. Watch very carefully as the foaming slows. This means the water is mostly gone and things happen quickly at this point.<\/li>\n<li>Continue whisking and watch as the liquid butter &#8211; not the foam on top &#8211; darkens.<\/li>\n<li>When it looks &#8220;lightly toast colored,&#8221; and brown bits start to appear in the liquid, take it off the heat and whisk another 15 seconds. Pour into a metal bowl, add the ice and stir until the ice is melted. Cover with plastic wrap and place in freezer until the butter is completely solid.<\/li>\n<li>Whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.<\/li>\n<li>Put the sugar, eggs and vanilla extract in the mixer with the <strong>whisk<\/strong> and whisk on medium-high speed until it forms thick ribbons when you pull the whisk out. This should take about 5 minutes, but might take a little longer. If you don&#8217;t get <em>thick ribbons<\/em>, keep whisking<em>.<\/em><\/li>\n<li>Put the <strong>paddle<\/strong> on the mixer and add the solid browned butter from the refrigerator and the brown sugar, and mix on medium for about 15 seconds. Mix <em>just<\/em> until combined.<\/li>\n<li>Add the flour\/salt\/baking soda mixture to the mixer and mix on low speed about 10 seconds or until <em>just<\/em> combined.<\/li>\n<li>Add the chocolate chunks and mix on low for a few seconds to combine.<\/li>\n<li>Put the mixture in a Ziploc, squeeze out all the air, seal and refrigerate 1 &#8211; 3 days &#8211; This part is really important. Sitting in the refrigerator greatly improves the texture and flavor.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<div><strong>Baking Directions<\/strong>:<\/div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>Preheat oven at 325\u00b0F (convection, if you have it). Make sure there&#8217;s enough space between the oven racks for good air circulation.<\/li>\n<li>Line the baking sheets with parchment paper.<\/li>\n<li>Dump the chilled, rested dough out on to a cutting board and break it up into small chunks with your sturdy knife. A lot of recipies recommend a small scoop, but having broken several I can tell you the knife works much better.<\/li>\n<li>Make small blobs of dough about the size of a golf ball and put 8 on each baking sheet. They should <strong>not<\/strong> be perfectly smooth and round. The &#8220;imperfections&#8221; make the edges interesting and crispier.<\/li>\n<li>Put the sheet pans in the oven and bake until the edges are golden. This is about 12 minutes in my oven. Yours is probably different.<\/li>\n<li>When baked, remove the sheet pan, and <strong>put the parchment paper with the cookies on the counter to cool<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Let the sheet pan cool off. If you leave the cookies on the sheet pan, they&#8217;ll bake too much while the pan is cooling.<\/li>\n<li>When you&#8217;re ready to bake the next batch, use a cool cookie sheet. A hot or warm cookie sheet makes the dough melt before baking and will give you poor results.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div><strong>Notes: <\/strong><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li>Buy <strong>bars<\/strong> of really good chocolate, not chips or morsels. The chips are coated with something to make them not clump in the bag and don&#8217;t work well. HErshey&#8217;s Special Dark chocolate works well. It&#8217;s not too sweet or too bitter.<\/li>\n<li>Refrigerating the mix for at least a day is necessary. It really improves the flavor.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This recipe is based on Chocolate Chunk Cookies by J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt.
