Heat on medium now, heat up the oil until bubbles start to form around a pair of chopsticks (~160C if you got a temp gun). Add in your egg, and it should quickly puff up. The technique here is to let the egg set, scoop and turn, wait to set, scoop and turn\u2026 you get the idea. The whole process should take only about ~30 seconds to get to the point where the eggs are about ~80% cooked. Once it\u2019s there, shut off the heat and give em a quick scramble to get something that looks a little more wispy. Take the eggs out, optionally reserving in a fine mesh strainer to allow any excess oil or moisture to drip out.<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0Give your wok a quick rinse, addd\u00a0 little oil and heat on medium.<\/li>\n<li>Go in with the pork slivers. Over the next ~15 seconds or so before the heat starts getting intense your goal is to spread out the pork so it doesn\u2019t clump.<\/li>\n<li>Up the heat to high. Stir-fry for about one minute until the pork starts to change color. Note that when stir-frying meat on a home stove, you don\u2019t wanna stir TOO often as you\u2019ll want a little bit of browning on the meat.<\/li>\n<li>Scooch the pork slivers to the side. If you\u2019re like us and err on the side of too little oil instead of too much, take stock of how much oil\u2019s remaining in the wok. If it needs a little extra, adding a touch more oil is no problem at all.<\/li>\n<li>Add in the ginger and leek and put the heat back down to medium-high. Stir fry about ~10 seconds, and add the port.<\/li>\n<li>Hit with ~a tablespoon of liaojiu by pouring the wine over the spatula and around the sides of the wok. This not only adds taste to the stir-fry, but also helps control the temperature so the aromatics don\u2019t scorch on us.<\/li>\n<li>Add the well drained mu\u2019er<em>(mushrooms)<\/em>.
