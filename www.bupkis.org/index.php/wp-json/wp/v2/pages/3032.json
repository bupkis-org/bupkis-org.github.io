Any non-frozen shrimp you see in the store are just frozen shrimp that the store thawed. There&#8217;s no reason to thaw them before you&#8217;re ready to cook, since the &#8220;spoilage clock&#8221; start ticking as soon as they get much above 0\u00b0F.<\/p>\n<p>Never buy pre-cooked shrimp, since you&#8217;re going to cook it. Twice-cooked shrimp are terrible.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The night before, if frozen:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Snip the corner off the bag and place the bag in a bowl, cut corner facing down to allow draining. Place in the refrigerator.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Cooking:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bring at least a gallon of water to a boil. When it boils add about 2 tsp of salt.<\/li>\n<li>Clean the shrimp! Remove the legs and all of the shell except for the tail and. If the seafood processor hasn&#8217;t done this for you, remove the &#8220;vein.&#8221; (actually the digestive tract) You want to eat the shrimp, not what it ate.<\/li>\n<li>Select a cast iron pan just large enough to hold the shrimp. Add the olive oil to a depth of about 1\/3&#8243; and set heat on medium<\/li>\n<li>Add a 1\/2 box of thin spaghetti (capellini) to boiling water.And set a timer for 4 minutes<\/li>\n<li>Add the garlic and chile to the pan<\/li>\n<li>Gently cook until the garlic just barely starts to turn translucent (about 4 minutes). If you see a lot of sizzling, reduce the heat. This should be very gentle.<\/li>\n<li>When the timer goes off, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">quickly<\/span> add the shrimp to the pan in a single layer, increase heat to medium-high, and restart the timer.
