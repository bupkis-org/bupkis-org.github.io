If the pot is too short, enough corn to cover the bottom will overflow the top.<\/p>\n<p>Next we need a lid, so the corn stays in the pot and not all over your floor. However since moisture is the enemy of crunchy popcorn, you absolutely don&#8217;t want that nice tight lid that came with the pot. What works much better is either a strainer or colander that&#8217;s large enough to cover the top of your pot.<\/p>\n<p>To that end, my favorite combination is a tall pasta\/stock pot and a big strainer to use as a cover.<\/p>\n<p>Last we need to discuss the actual popcorn and oil. There&#8217;s absolutely no need to spend $4\/Lb for any corn sold by a white-haired guy, or that has the work &#8220;gourmet&#8221; on the package. You <strong>do<\/strong> want the freshest popcorn you can find, which means that you want to buy from a place that sells <strong>a lot<\/strong> of popcorn.<\/p>\n<p>So far my favorites have been WalMart &#8220;Great Value&#8221; popcorn and Wegman&#8217;s Store brand.<\/p>\n<p>The oil needs to be Peanut Oil because of it&#8217;s high smoking point. Popcorn uses a lot of heat and to borrow a phrase from Alton Brown, burned oil is <strong>not<\/strong> &#8220;good eats&#8221; .<\/p>\n<p>However that&#8217;s enough talk Let&#8217;s cook!<\/p>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Ingredients:<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><\/td>\n<td><\/td>\n<td>Popcorn &#8211; Really fresh &#8220;generic&#8221; is much better than old &#8220;gourmet&#8221; &#8211; See recipe<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><\/td>\n<td><\/td>\n<td>Peanut Oil (plain not &#8220;roasted&#8221;)<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><\/td>\n<td><\/td>\n<td><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bupkis.org\/index.php\/recipes-2\/snacks\/popcorn-salt\">Salt<\/a> to taste (optional)<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1\/2<\/td>\n<td>Stick<\/td>\n<td>Unsalted Butter &#8211; <strong>not margarine<\/strong> &#8211; melted (optional)<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p><strong>Directions<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you&#8217;re going to use butter, place it in a small cup and microwave for about 40 seconds or until melted.<\/li>\n<li>Add 3 or 4 kernels to the pot.<\/li>\n<li>Add peanut oil to a depth of about 1\/2 a kernel<\/li>\n<li>Cover pot with strainer, put on stove burner, set to medium-high and wait for all four kernels to pop.<em> If the oil smokes before all the kernels pop, you probably have old corn and need to replace it.<\/em><\/li>\n<li>Immediately add enough popcorn to cover the bottom of the pot.
