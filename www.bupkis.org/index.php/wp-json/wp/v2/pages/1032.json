Any non-frozen shrimp you see in the store are just frozen shrimp that the store thawed. There&#8217;s no reason to thaw them before you&#8217;re ready to cook, since the &#8220;spoilage clock&#8221; start ticking as soon as they get much above 0\u00b0F.<\/p>\n<p>Never buy pre-cooked shrimp, since you&#8217;re going to cook it. Twice-cooked shrimp are terrible.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The night before, if frozen:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Snip the corner off the bag and place the bag in a bowl, cut corner facing down to allow draining. Place in the refrigerator in a bowl to catch the water.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Cooking:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clean the shrimp! Remove the legs and all of the shell except for the tail. If the seafood processor hasn&#8217;t done this for you, remove the &#8220;vein.&#8221; (actually the digestive tract) You want to eat the shrimp, not what it ate.<\/li>\n<li>Select a cast iron pan just large enough to hold the shrimp. Add the olive oil to a depth of about 1\/3&#8243;<\/li>\n<li>Add the garlic and chile, and set the heat to medium.<\/li>\n<li>Cook until the garlic just barely starts to turn translucent.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Quickly<\/span> add the shrimp to the pan in a single layer. As soon as the shrimp changes color on the bottom, turn the shrimp over.<\/li>\n<li>When they turn color on the second side, they&#8217;re done. Sprinkle on a pinch of salt, all of the parsley and serve right in the pan, along with a good, crusty bread to dip in the beautiful slightly-smoky, spicy, garlic-pepper-shrimp oil<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Serves about 3 for dinner, or 6 as an appetizer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Variation:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Before saut\u00e9ing the shrimp, toss a 1\/2 box of thin spaghetti (capellini) into boiling, salted water. When the pasta is about half cooked, start the shrimp, then when the pasta is done, drain well, dump into the pan of shrimp, gently toss and serve immediately.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Gambas Ajillo (Garlic Shrimp) has a huge, bold, well-balanced flavor, combining fragrant, spicy olive oil, delicate shrimp, warm garlic and hot, smoky chiles.
