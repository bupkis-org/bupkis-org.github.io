And I did.<\/p>\n<p>It was <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">awesome<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>Way better than the food truck or the restaurant.<\/p>\n<p>So here it is.

Leave 12-24 hours<\/li>\n<li>Make the <a class=\"ingredients-link\" href=\"\/index.php\/recipes-2\/sauces\/tahini-sauce\">Tahini Sauce<\/a> and refrigerate. Ideally, it should refrigerate overnight to let the flavors bloom.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5>Cooking day:<\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Put the wire rack in the sheet pan (used for draining).<\/li>\n<li>Put all the dried spices into a spice grinder or mortar and pestle and grind to a powder.<\/li>\n<li>Put the salt, the ground up spices, garlic, onion and beans into the food processor and pulse with the chopping blade (looks like a curved lawnmower blade) until the chunks are about the same size as dried couscous.<\/li>\n<li>Add the flour and all the parsley and pulse until the parsley is chopped up. Don&#8217;t process too much or the falafel will be mushy.<\/li>\n<li>Add the oil to the pot, place the thermometer in the oil and heat until 350\u00b0F<\/li>\n<li>Take a ping-pong ball sized chunk of\u00a0 falafel mixture and form into a ball then flatten between your palms to form a &#8220;flying saucer&#8221; shape.\u00a0 Carefully add to the oil and cook until golden brown, to get a feel for how long it takes. Place on the wire rack to drain.<\/li>\n<li>Wait for the oil to heat back up to 350\u00b0F then add another 4-6 balls and cook. Don&#8217;t cook too many at once or the oil will cool off and your falafel will be greasy.<\/li>\n<li>Repeat until the mixture is gone or you have enough falafels.<\/li>\n<li>Serve immediately with <a class=\"ingredients-link\" href=\"\/index.php\/recipes-2\/sauces\/tahini-sauce\">Tahini Sauce<\/a> and the veggies of your choice, in a half-pita, if you like. I like it with thinly sliced onion and chopped tomato and Tahini Sauce.<\/li>\n<li>If you don&#8217;t use all of it, save the uncooked mixture and use the next day. Don&#8217;t cook extra balls and reheat, since they&#8217;re <em>much<\/em> better freshly cooked than reheated.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Enjoy!<\/p>\n<h2>Safety Note!<\/h2>\n<p>I would never do anything with a pot of hot oil on a stove without a good fire extinguisher handy.<\/p>\n<p>When you go to buy one, think of the &#8220;knife scene&#8221; in Crocodile Dundee where he says &#8220;That&#8217;s not a knife, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>this<\/em><\/span> is a knife!&#8221; and pulls out his giant knife.<\/p>\n<p>Nobody who ever had a fire has ever said &#8220;Wow! I wish my fire extinguisher was smaller.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Get a real one. They&#8217;re rated with number\/letter combinations as xA, xBC, which relates to the size fire they can put out.<\/p>\n<p>I would never have anything less than a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kidde.com\/SafetyMadeSimple\/Pages\/HowtoChooseaFireExtinguisher.aspx\">3A\/40BC extinguisher <\/a>.
